           <h3> This is The Solution To The Problem On Space Science </h3>
           <h4>The current distance from the Earth to Mars is 176,797,277 km and it take 687 days for mars (the red planet) to make one complete revolution</h4>
           <h5> As stated in the question, the spaceship moves with a speed of 1000km/hr, and since the currnt distance from the earth to mars is 176,797,277km, the spaceship will take 176,797.277 hours to reach the mars orbits.
           if 1 litre of compressed oxygen can serve a single astronaut for 12 hours, it means that, from earth to mars' orbit, a single astronaut will use approximately 14,733 litres of compressed oxygen. And since there are 10 astronauts, they will need altogether a total of 147,330 litres of compressed oxygen available for the earth to mars distance trip.
           Once the astronauts land on mars, they will begin their research and when they are through with their research, they will have to stay 687 days for the spaceship to align with the planet mars. Therefore, they will probably need more oxygen. It takes mars 24 hrs 40mins to complete one rotation (to make a day). And so that will make approximately 24.67 hours a day in mars. if an astronaut makes use of i litre in 12 hours, then in 16,948 hours ( the 687 days in mars) the astronaut will make use of 1,412 litres of compressed oxygen. that means the 10 astronauts will need to have 14,120 litres of compressed oxygen.</h5>
           <h5> The summary is that, the astronauts will need 147,330 litres of compressed oxygen for the trip distance going to mars, 14,120 litres of compressed oxygen for the time they will stay on mars, and 147,330 litres of compressed oxygen for the trip going back to earth. 
           Meaning that the 10 astronaut will need approximately 308,780 litres of compressed oxygen for the entire trip.</h5>
